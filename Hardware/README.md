If you're interested in making a Sympetrum pin, the gerbers you want are the [FF1.1/](FF1.1)'s. This the final design (images in the (media)[../Media/] directory above, courtesy of OSHPark).

If you want to make modifications, all design files made with [KiCAD](http://kicad-pcb.org/), a "Cross Platform and Open Source Electronics Design Automation Suite." It's very powerful, but has a steep learning curve.
